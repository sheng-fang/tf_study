# TF study track

There are 2 parts (folders) in this repository.

The first one is reproduction of the official tutorial.

The second part is the practices during the study of the friendly tutorial https://lyhue1991.github.io/eat_tensorflow2_in_30_days.
This tutorial is written in Chinese. I do not translate it into English, but write all the important notes and the demo tests in jupyter-notebook. 
If you want a English version, leave a message to me or the author of https://lyhue1991.github.io/eat_tensorflow2_in_30_days
